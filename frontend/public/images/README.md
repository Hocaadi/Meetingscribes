   - Choose a frame that clearly shows the MeetingScribe interface
   - Select a moment that demonstrates the value of the application
   - You can use a screenshot from a key moment in the video

2. Save your thumbnail as `demo-thumbnail.jpg` in this directory

3. Recommended specifications:
   - Resolution: 1280x720 (16:9 aspect ratio)
   - Format: JPG or PNG
