# Videos Directory

This directory is for video assets used in the MeetingScribe application.

## Missing Demo Video

The application is looking for a file named `demo-video.mp4` in this directory. You should place your demo video here with that exact name.

If you don't have a demo video, you can download a sample video and rename it to `demo-video.mp4`.

## Placeholder

Until you have a proper demo video, the application will show a fallback message or placeholder image.

## Instructions for Replacing with Sora-Generated Video

1. Generate your video using the Sora prompt provided
2. Name your final video file `demo-video.mp4`
3. Place the video file in this directory
4. Create a thumbnail image from your video (you can take a screenshot of a key moment)
5. Name your thumbnail `demo-thumbnail.jpg` and place it in the `/images` directory

## Sora Prompt for Reference

```
Create a professional 60-second video showcasing "MeetingScribe", an AI-powered meeting transcription and analysis tool. 

The video should show a sleek, modern web application with a blue gradient navigation bar (RGB: 59, 130, 246 to 37, 99, 235). Begin with a user logging into the application through a clean, minimal sign-in page. Show the username/email and password being entered, followed by the dashboard loading.

Next, demonstrate a user uploading an audio file of a business meeting through a drag-and-drop interface or file selector. Show a processing animation with a progress bar, followed by the AI generating a transcript in real-time with text appearing progressively.

Then show the application automatically identifying and categorizing key elements from the meeting: action items appearing in a bulleted list, decisions highlighted in green boxes, and follow-up tasks in blue sections. Include a scene where the user clicks to download a professional-looking DOCX report.

The final scene should show a split screen of professionals in a meeting room and their conversation being transcribed on the MeetingScribe dashboard in real-time, emphasizing the productivity benefits.

The video should have a clean, professional aesthetic with blue and white as primary colors, matching the application's design. Include subtle UI animations when transitioning between screens. No spoken dialogue is needed, but include appropriate background music suitable for a business productivity tool.
